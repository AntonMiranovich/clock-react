Project Description: Clock Interface

The clock interface project is an application developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the DOM (Document Object Model). It showcases a digital clock that displays the current time

The interface is designed using HTML to structure the different elements of the clock, CSS to style and position the elements

Key features of the clock interface:

Displaying Current Time: The interface dynamically updates to show the current time, including hours, minutes, and seconds. This is achieved using JavaScript to retrieve the system time and update the corresponding elements in the HTML.

By combining HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the DOM, the clock interface project delivers a visually appealing and functional clock that provides users with an intuitive way to track and engage with time.
